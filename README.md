## Project Objective
**Option A**: 
- Design a program that will predict the next item a user will re-purchase.

**Option B**: 
- Design a program that will seperate customer into different segments and classify a new customer into a know segment.


## Possible Text Mining Algorithem Options
1. K-Means
    - "unsupervised learning algorithm that slove clustering problems. 
Define k centroids which are used to label new data.
Classical way for text categorization."

2. Naive Bayes Classifier
    - "Simple probabilistic algorithm for the classification tasks."

3. K-Nearest Neighbor
    - "Simple algorithm that stores all existing data objects and classifies the new data objects based on a similarity measure."
    
4. Support Vector Machines
    - "Draw lines that separate the groups according to some patterns. For classification problems and outliers detections." 
    
5. Decision Tree
    - "Predicts the value of a target variable based on several input variables. For classification or decision making."
